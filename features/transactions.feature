Feature: Transactions
  In order to atomically transmit frames
  As a client
  I want transactions

  Scenario: Applying a transaction to a series of frames
    Given a 1.1 connection between client and broker
    And a transaction scope named "t-0001"
    When the client begins the transaction scope
    And the client acks a message by ID "m-1234" and subscription "s-5678" within the scope
    And the client nacks a message by ID "m-9012" and subscription "s-5678" within the scope
    And the client aborts the transaction scope
    Then the broker should have received a "BEGIN" frame with headers
    | header-name | header-value |
    | transaction | t-0001       |
    Then the broker should have received an "ACK" frame with headers
    | header-name  | header-value |
    | transaction  | t-0001       |
    | message-id   | m-1234       |
    | subscription | s-5678       |
    And the broker should have received a "NACK" frame with headers
    | header-name  | header-value |
    | transaction  | t-0001       |
    | message-id   | m-9012       |
    | subscription | s-5678       |
    And the broker should have received an "ABORT" frame with headers
    | header-name | header-value |
    | transaction | t-0001       |

  Scenario: Applying a transaction to a successful block
    Given a 1.1 connection between client and broker
    When the client executes a successful transaction block named "t-0002"
    Then the broker should have received a "BEGIN" frame with headers
    | header-name | header-value |
    | transaction | t-0002       |
    And the broker should have received an "ACK" frame with headers
    | header-name  | header-value |
    | transaction  | t-0002       |
    And the broker should have received a "SEND" frame with headers
    | header-name  | header-value |
    | transaction  | t-0002       |
    And the broker should have received a "NACK" frame with headers
    | header-name  | header-value |
    | transaction  | t-0002       |
    And the broker should have received a "COMMIT" frame with headers
    | header-name | header-value |
    | transaction | t-0002       |

  Scenario: Applying a transaction to an unsuccessful block
    Given a 1.1 connection between client and broker
    When the client executes an unsuccessful transaction block named "t-0002"
    Then the broker should have received a "BEGIN" frame with headers
    | header-name | header-value |
    | transaction | t-0002       |
    And the broker should have received an "ACK" frame with headers
    | header-name  | header-value |
    | transaction  | t-0002       |
    And the broker should have received a "SEND" frame with headers
    | header-name  | header-value |
    | transaction  | t-0002       |
    And the broker should have received a "NACK" frame with headers
    | header-name  | header-value |
    | transaction  | t-0002       |
    And the broker should have received a "ABORT" frame with headers
    | header-name | header-value |
    | transaction | t-0002       |
