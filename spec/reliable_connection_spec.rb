      # This is really awful, though appropriately named.  You REALLY should
      # favor composition over inheritance, and here is further proof of that.
      # Your options here were to mock and stub all of TCP connection so you could
      # raise IO Errors in a controlled and testable way, or to slap a mock
      # module in the inheritance chain that you could stub.
      # The former would result in writing a lot of low-level crap that I don't
      # really care about, since I want to test the exception handling at a
      # much higher level.  If I tried to tell a TCPSocket mock exactly how many
      # times I should expect a read or write statement (or any of the lower level
      # methods those methods call) I might as well be writing a test suite for
      # basic networking.  So, here we are, splicing in a module into the
      # inheritance chain between ReliableConnection and BasicConnection, and
      # stubbing the methods that would have otherwise percolated up from
      # Reliable to Basic.  I want to get back to composition with delegation
      # and decoration, but decogator hasn't been tested well enough, so
      # this crap will stay for a little while.
