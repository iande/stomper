Stomper is a library for connecting to and interacting with a message broker
service that supports the Stomp [1.0](http://stomp.github.com/stomp-specification-1-0.html)
and [1.1](http://stomp.github.com/stomp-specification-1-1.html) protocols.

As the Stomp 1.1 specification is currently a draft, this code base is bound
to change quite a bit while the specification stabilizes.

Further, this branch will be a major re-working of master and offer a significantly
different API.  I believe that use of this gem is fairly limited at this point,
so I have an opportunity to get away with such a drastic change now.
