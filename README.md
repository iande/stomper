#Stomper 2.0.0pre1

Stomper is a library for connecting to and interacting with a message broker
service that supports the Stomp [1.0](http://stomp.github.com/stomp-specification-1-0.html)
and [1.1](http://stomp.github.com/stomp-specification-1-1.html) protocols.

As the Stomp 1.1 specification is stabilizing, there should not be major
changes to this codebase once all of the features are fully implemented.
There is still a significant amount of work that must be done before this
gem is ready for any use. It can be used right now, but the API will be
rather unpleasant to deal with for common use cases.

##Still in the Works

There are a few features that have not yet been implemented, hence why we're
still on a prerelease version number. The following is a list of the major
deficiencies of the gem, but this list is not necessarily exhaustive.

* Heart-beating is not yet implemented
* Receivers have not been implemented (looking to provide threaded
  and possibly non-threaded versions, but a threaded is a minimum)
* Thread-safety needs some work and some tests
* Event callbacks need a wrapper so they can be unbound
* Subscription handlers need implemented
* Full stack testing (probably through cucumber)

As these issues are resolved, I'll drop them from the list (and potentially
add other issues)

##Example Usage

    # Establish a connection to the broker
    con = Stomper::Connection.open('stomp://host.example.com')
    
    # Starts a receiver to read frames sent by the broker to the client.
    # By default, this will create a new thread (once it is implemented)
    con.start
    
    # SUBSCRIBE to the '/queue/test' destination
    con.subscribe('/queue/test') do |message|
      con.ack(message)
      puts "Message Received: #{message.body}"
    end
    
    # Deliver a SEND frame to the broker
    con.send("/queue/test", "this is a tribute")
    
    # A transaction in a block
    con.with_transaction do |t|
      t.send("/queue/test2", "first in a transaction")
      t.send("/queue/test2", "second in a transaction")
      # A transaction block is automatically finalized once the block
      # finishes. If no exception is raised within the block, the transaction
      # is committed, otherwise it is aborted.
    end
    
    # A 'free' transaction scope
    trans = con.with_transaction
    
    trans.send("/queue/other", "test message", { :'x-special-header' => 'marked'})
    con.subscribe("/queue/other") do |m|
      # Frame headers can be referenced by Symbol or String
      if m['x-special-header'] == 'marked'
        trans.ack(m)
        # A 'free' transaction scope must be explicitly committed
        trans.commit
      end
    end
    
    # A receipt scope
    con.with_receipt do |r|
      puts "Got receipt for SEND frame"
    end.send("/queue/receipted", "this message will generate a receipt")
    
    # A 'free' receipt scope
    receipter = con.with_receipt { |r| puts "Got a receipt: #{r[:receipt-id]}" }
    
    # Automatically generates a receipt ID.
    receipter.subscribe("/topic/example")
    # Or a receipt ID can be specified with a :receipt header value.
    receipter.send("/queue/receipted", "also generates a receipt", :receipt => 'rcp-1234')
    
    # Listen to some events
    con.on_message do |frame|
      puts "Incoming MESSAGE: #{frame.body}"
    end
    
    con.on_subscribe do |frame|
      puts "Client is subscribing to #{frame[:destination]}"
    end
    
    con.after_transmitting do |frame|
      puts "Client is transmitting #{frame.command}"
    end
    
    con.on_connection_terminated do
      $stderr.puts "Connection terminated abnormally!"
    end
    
    # Open a connection to a broker through 'open-uri'
    require 'open-uri'
    open('stomp://myuser:superSecret@host.domain.tld:61613') do |stomp|
      # Connection to broker will be connected when a block is started
      # and disconnected when the block completes.
      stomp.send("/queue/open-uri", "a message")
      stomp.send("/queue/open-uri", "another message")
    end
