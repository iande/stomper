# A basic stomp client connection.  This class is not meant to be synchronized
# nor is it meant to be reliable.  We will layer that functionality atop
# this class with the Client and ReliableConnection classes respectively.
# The only state I want instances of this class to maintain are the base
# uri (defined through initialize and then left alone) and the raw socket
# to the stomp server.  Most higher level code should make use of the Client
# class intead of this.
