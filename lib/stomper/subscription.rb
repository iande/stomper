module Stomper
  # A representation of a subscription to a stomp broker destination.  The
  # attributes +id+, +destination+, +ack+ and +selector+ have the same
  # semantic meaning as the headers of a Stomp "SUBSCRIBE" frame with the same
  # name.
  class Subscription
    attr_reader :id, :destination, :ack, :selector

    # Creates a new Subscription instance from the given parameters.
    # The +destination_or_options+ parameter can either be a string
    # specification of the destination, such as "/queue/target", or a hash
    # corresponding to the headers of a "SUBSCRIBE" frame
    # (eg: { :destination => "/queue/target", :id => "sub-001", ... })
    #
    # The optional +subscription_id+ parameter is a string corresponding
    # to the name of this subscription.  If this parameter is specified, it
    # should be unique within the context of a given Stomper::Client, otherwise
    # the behavior of the Stomper::Client#unsubscribe method may have unintended
    # consequences.
    #
    # The optional +ack+ parameter specifies the mode that a client
    # will use to acknowledge received messages and may be either :client or :auto.
    # The default, :auto, does not require the client to notify the broker when
    # it has received a message; however, setting +ack+ to :client will require
    # each message received by this subscription to be acknowledged through the
    # use of Stomper::Client#ack in order to ensure proper interaction between
    # client and broker.
    #
    # The +selector+ parameter (again, optional) sets a SQL 92 selector for
    # this subscription with the stomp broker as per the Stomp Protocol specification.
    # Support of this functionality is entirely the responsibility of the broker,
    # there is no client side filtering being done on incoming messages.
    #
    # When a message is "received" by an instance of Subscription, the supplied
    # +block+ is inovked with the received message sent as a parameter.
    #
    # If no +subscription_id+ is specified, either explicitly or through a
    # hash key of 'id' in +destination_or_options+, one may be automatically
    # generated of the form +sub-<Time.now.to_f>+.  The automatic generation
    # of a subscription id occurs if and only if naive? returns false.
    #
    # While direct creation of Subscription instances is possible, the preferred
    # method is for them to be constructed by a Stomper::Client through the use
    # of the Stomper::Client#subscribe method.
