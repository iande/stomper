  # Creates a connection to a broker specified by the suppled uri. The given
  # uri will be resolved to a URI instance through +URI.parse+. The final URI object must
  # provide a {::URI::STOMP#create_socket create_socket} method, or an error
  # will be raised. Both {::URI::STOMP} and {::URI::STOMP_SSL} provide this
  # method, so string URIs with a scheme of either "stomp" or "stomp+ssl" will
  # work automatically.
  # Most connection options can be supplied through query parameters specified in the URI or
  # through an optional +Hash+ parameter. If the same option is configured in
  # both the URI's parameters and the options hash, the options hash takes
  # precedence.  Certain options, those pertaining to SSL settings for
  # instance, must be configured through the options hash.
  #
  # @param [String] uri a string representing the URI to the message broker's
  #   Stomp interface.
  # @param [{Symbol => Object}] options additional options for the connection.
  #
  # @example Connecting to a broker on 'host.domain.tld' and a port of 12345
  #   con = Stomper::Connection.new('stomp://host.domain.tld:12345')
  #
  # @example Connecting with login credentials
  #   con = Stomper::Connection.new('stomp://username:secret@host.domain.tld')
  #
  # @example Connecting using a default queue for delivering SEND frames and receiving MESSAGE frames
  #   con = Stomper::Connection.new('stomp://host/queue/testing')
  #   con = Stomper::Connection.new('stomp://host/?default_destination=/queue/testing')
  #   con = Stomper::Connection.new('stomp://host', :default_destination => '/queue/testing')
  #
  # @example Connecting using Stomp protocol 1.1, sending client beats once per second, and no interest in server beats.
  #   con = Stomper::Connection.new('stomp://host/?versions=1.1&heartbeats=1000&heartbeats=0')
  #   con = Stomper::Connection.new('stomp://host', :versions => '1.1', :heartbeats => [1000, 0])
  #   # both result in:
  #   con.heartbeat #=> [1000, 0]
  #   con.version   #=> ['1.1']
  #
  # @example Repeated options in URI and options hash
  #   con = Stomper::Connection.new('stomp://host?versions=1.1&versions=1.0', :versions => '1.1')
  #   con.version #=> '1.1'
  #   # In this case, the version query parameter value +[1.1 , 1.0]+ is
  #   # overridden by the options hash setting +1.1+
  #
  #   con = Stomper::Connection.new('stomp://host/queue/lowest_priority?default_destination=/queue/middle_priority', :default_destination => '/queue/highest_priority')
  #   con.default_destination  #=> '/queue/highest_priority'
  #   # In this case, the URI's path +/queue/lowest_priority+ is overridden the
  #   # query parameter +/queue/middle_priority+, but both are overridden by
  #   # the options hash setting +/queue/highest_priority+.
