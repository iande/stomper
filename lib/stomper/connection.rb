    # The +uri+ parameter may be either a URI object, or something that can
    # be parsed by URI.parse, such as a string.
    # Some examples of acceptable +uri+ forms include:
    # [stomp:///] Connection will be made to 'localhost' on port 61613 with no login credentials.
    # [stomp+ssl:///] Same as above, but connection will be made on port 61612 and wrapped by SSL.
    # [stomp://user:pass@host.tld] Connection will be made to 'host.tld', authenticating as 'user' with a password of 'pass'.
    # [stomp://user:pass@host.tld:86753] Connection will be made to 'host.tld' on port 86753, authenticating as above.
    # [stomp://host.tld:86753] Connection will be made to 'host.tld' on port 86753, with no authentication.
    #
    # In order to wrap the connection with SSL, the schema of +uri+ must be 'stomp+ssl';
    # however, if SSL is not required, the schema is essentially ignored.
    # The default port for the 'stomp+ssl' schema is 61612, all other schemas
    # default to port 61613.
