  # will be raised. Both {::URI::STOMP} and {::URI::STOMP_SSL} provide this
  # method, so string URIs with a scheme of either "stomp" or "stomp+ssl" will
  # work automatically.
  # Most connection options can be supplied through query parameters specified in the URI or
  # through an optional +Hash+ parameter. If the same option is configured in

  # precedence.  Certain options, those pertaining to SSL settings for

  # @param [String] uri a string representing the URI to the message broker's
  #   Stomp interface.
  # @param [{Symbol => Object}] options additional options for the connection.
  # @option options [Array<String>] :versions (['1.0', '1.1']) protocol versions
  #   this connection should allow.
  # @option options [Array<Fixnum>] :heartbeats ([0, 0]) heartbeat timings for
  #   this connection in milliseconds (a zero indicates that heartbeating is
  #   not desired from the client or the broker) 
  # @option options [{Symbol => Object}] :ssl ({}) SSL specific options to
  #   pass on when creating an {Stomper::Sockets::SSL SSL connection}.
  # @option options [String] :host (nil) Host name to pass as +host+ header
  #   on CONNECT frames (will use actual connection hostname if not set)
  # @option options [String] :login (nil) Username to send as +login+ header
  #   for credential authenticated connections.
  # @option options [String] :passcode (nil) Password to send as +passcode+ header
  #   for credential authenticated connections.

  # @example Connecting to a broker on 'host.domain.tld' and a port of 12345

  # @example Connecting with login credentials

  # @example Connecting using Stomp protocol 1.1, sending client beats once per second, and no interest in server beats.
