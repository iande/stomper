    # threads, we don't want to bind everything up in the same transaction,
    # so we emulate and delegate!
    # Within a transaction, every send, ack, abort and commit command
    # should be given the same transaction id.  Keep an eye on nesting
    # transasctions, as the stomp protocol has been kind enough to let us
    # name our transactions.
