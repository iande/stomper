module Stomper
  # A high-level representation of a connection to a Stomp message broker.
  # Instances of Client can be shared safely between threads, all mutating
  # methods should be properly synchronized.  Interactions with the stomp
  # message broker through instances of Client are generally simpler than
  # doing so through instances of Connection.  Client instances do not require
  # the use of Stomper::Frames::ClientFrame objects to transmit and receive
  # information, instead relying on specific method calls to do so.
  #
  # === Example Usage
  #   client = Stomper::Client.new("stomp://localhost:61613")
  #   client.start
  #
  #   client.subscribe("/queue/target1") do |msg|
  #     puts "Received Message: #{msg.body}"
  #   end
  #
  #   client.send("/queue/target1", "this is a test")
  #   client.send("/queue/target1", "this persists", { :persistent => true })
  #
  #   client.transaction do |t1|
  #     t1.send("/queue/target1", "this will never be seen")
  #     raise "Forced Exception"
  #   end
  #
  #   client.unsubscribe("/queue/target1")
  #
  #   client.stop
  #   client.close
  #

    # Creates a new Client instance that will connect to the stomp broker
    # designated by the +uri+ parameter.  Additionally, +options+ may be
    # specified as a hash, and are passed along to the underlying connection.
    # For details on the format of +uri+ and the acceptable +options+, see
    # Stomper::Connection.

    # The +id_or_frame+ parameter may be either the message-id header of
    # the received message, or an actual instance of Stomper::Frames::Message.
