    # => :host: hostname of server
    # => :port: port of server
    # => :username: username for authentication
    # => :password: password for authentication
    # => :secure: boolean indicating the use of an SSL connection

    # Additional Options
    # => :reliable: boolean indicating if the connection is reliable (default: false)
    # => :delay: delay between connection retries in seconds (default: 5)
    # => :max_retries: number of times to retry connecting when disconnected (default: unlimited)
