module Stomper
  module TransactorInterface
    # Creates a new Stomper::Transaction object and evaluates
    # the supplied +block+ within a transactional context.  If
    # the block executes successfully, the transaction is committed,
    # otherwise it is aborted.  This method is meant to provide a less
    # tedious approach to transactional messaging than the +begin+,
    # +abort+ and +commit+ methods.
